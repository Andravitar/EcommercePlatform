# Scalable E-Commerce Platform
The platform will handle various aspects of an online store, such as product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart, payment processing, and order management. Each of these features will be implemented as separate microservices, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.

#Core Microservices:
Here are the core microservices implemented:
- User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Product Catalog Service: Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.
- Shopping Cart Service: Manages usersâ€™ shopping carts, including adding/removing items and updating quantities.
- Order Service: Processes orders, including placing orders, tracking order status, and managing order history.
- Payment Service: Handles payment processing, integrating with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Notification Service: Sends email and SMS notifications for various events (e.g., order confirmation, shipping updates). e.g.(Twilio or SendGrid)

#Additional Components:
In addition to the core microservices, I am including the following components to enhance the scalability, reliability, and manageability of your e-commerce platform:
- API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. e.g. (NGINX)
- Service Discovery: Automatically detects and manages service instances. e.g. (Eureka)
- Centralized Logging: Aggregates logs from all microservices for easy monitoring and debugging. e.g. (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Docker & Docker Compose: Containerize each microservice and manages their orchestration, networking, and scaling. Docker Compose can be used to define and manage multi-container applications.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automates the build, test, and deployment process of each microservice. e.g. (Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions)
